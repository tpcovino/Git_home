# Summary

Evapotranspiration (ET) refers to the combined losses of water from the land surface to the atmosphere via evaporation and transpiration. Transpiration is loss of water from plants to the atmosphere and often accounts for a majority of total ET. Due to challenges in measuring ET, many estimation approaches have been developed. In this lab we will use two common methods: the Penman-Monteith and the Blaney-Criddle approaches to estimating ET. Please work through the lab, including required readings and video, up to the synthesis questions prior to lab on Thursday. During Thursday lab we will work on modeling ET in R and I will get you started on the project. You are welcome to collaborate with your colleagues in class but all work submitted and all responses must be your own.

## Overall Learning Objectives:

At the end of this module, students will understand the key processes driving evaporation and transpiration. Additionally, students will estimate ET using Penman-Monteith and Blaney-Criddle methods, identify how these ET methods differ, and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each.

# Modeling ET

###  Penman-Monteith

The Penman approach is an energy balance and mass transfer method to estimate evaporation from open water, bare soil, and grass using climatological data as input:

![](images/Penman_1.png){width=50%}

where, λE = evaporative latent heat flux (MJ m^-2^ d^-1^), Δ = slope of the saturated vapor pressure curve, Rn = net radiation flux (MJ m^-2^ d^-1^), G = ground heat flux (MJ m^-2^ d^-1^), γ = psychrometric constant (kPa °C^-1^), and Ea = vapor flux (mm d^-1^) (2)

Including a bulk surface resistance term, Montieth further modified Penman (using daily values):

![](images/Penman_2.png){width=50%}

where ρa = air density (kg m^-^3), $C_p$ = specific heat of dry air (J kg^-1^ K^-1^), $e_s^o$ = mean saturated vapor pressure (kPa), $e_a$ = mean daily ambient vapor pressure (kPa), $r_av$ = bulk surface aerodynamic resistance for water vapor (s m^-1^), and $r_s$ = the canopy surface resistance (s m^-1^).

### Blaney-Criddle

Blaney-Criddle is a more simplistic model compared to Penman-Monteith. It is more commonly used when meteorological data are unavailable and calculates evapotranspiration for a reference crop using mean monthly temperature. 


ETo = p(0.46Tmean + 8) 

where, ETo = Reference crop evapotranspiration (in mm/day) as an average for a one month period 

T mean = mean daily temperature (°C)

p = mean daily percentage of annual daytime hours



The mean daily percentage of annual daytime hours, p, is calculated based on the latitude of the site.

###  Sites

We will use 2 SCAN sites that have the necessary data to complete this analysis. We will use each method described above to estimate ET for Florida (2009) and Montana (808) SCAN sites. Accordingly, we will be evaluating differences in model estimates across widely differening climate. 


###  Analysis

In class on Thursday I will demonstrate the basic approaches to modeling ET in R Studio with each of these approaches. I will not give you all of the code to do so, but I will give you the building blocks from which you will be able complete the project.
