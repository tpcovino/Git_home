<h2>Downloading the data</h2>
<div id="section-installing-and-using-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>Installing and using packages</h3>
<p>In order to download river flow and height data we will first need to load a package called <code>dataRetrieval</code> this is a package run by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and it provides access to data from over 8000 river monitoring stations in the United States and millions of water quantity and quality records. You can learn more about the data from the USGS <a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis" target="_blank">here</a>. To use packages we first have to install them using the command <code>install.packages</code> and then load them using the command <code>library</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## Install the package if it&#39;s not already installed by uncommenting the line 
#below

#install.packages(&#39;dataRetrieval&#39;)


#Load this package and a few others
library(dataRetrieval) # Gets usgs data
library(tidyverse) #For tidying data
library(magrittr) #for pipes
library(dygraphs) # For mapping
library(learnr) #Makes all this interactive
library(ggthemes) #prettier plots
library(xts) #Time series plots
library(dygraphs) # interactive plots
library(EcoHydRology) #A bunch of hydrologic tools including baseflow analysis
library(sf) #Spatial package
library(mapview) # maps!

## Setting up output controls
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = F, warning = F, comment = F)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-using-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>Using packages</h3>
<p>Once we have loaded the package we can use the special functions that it brings to the table. In this case <code>dataRetrival</code> provides a function called <code>readNWISdv</code> which can download daily data (or daily values, hence readNWIS<em>dv</em>) for specific monitoring locations. But how do we use this function? Try <code>?readNWISdv</code> to get more details.</p>
<p>So the <code>readNWISdv</code> command requires a few key arguments. First <code>siteNumbers</code>, these are simply the site identifiers that the USGS uses to track different monitoring stations and in our case that number for our two rivers in Oregon are: West Fork and East Fork Ashland Creeks and Elk Creek with USGS Site Numbers of: <code>14353500</code> and <code>14308500</code>, which you can find <a href="https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis/uv/?cb_00060=on&amp;cb_00065=on&amp;format=gif_default&amp;site_no=14353000&amp;period=&amp;begin_date=2018-08-06&amp;end_date=2020-08-10" target="_blank">here</a>. The second argument is the <code>parameterCd</code> which is a cryptic code that indicates what kind of data you want to download. In this case we want to download river flow data. River flow tells us how much water is moving past a given point and is correlated with the height of the river water. This code is <code>00060</code> for discharge which means river flow. Lastly we need to tell the <code>readNWISdv</code> command the time period for which we want data which is <code>startDate</code> which we will set to 2010, and <code>endDate</code> which we will set to the current day using the command <code>Sys.Date()</code>. These arguments should be in the YYYY-MM-DD format. With all this knowledge of how the command works, we can finally download some data, directly into R!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>o_q &lt;- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = c(&#39;14353500&#39;,&#39;14353000&#39;,&#39;14308500&#39;),
                     parameterCd = c(&#39;00060&#39;),
                     startDate = &#39;2015-10-01&#39;,
                     endDate = Sys.Date())</code></pre>

</div>
<div id="section-explore-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Explore the data</h2>
<div id="section-look-at-data-structure" class="section level3">
<h3>Look at data structure</h3>
<p>Now that we have our dataframe called <code>o_q</code>, we can explore the properties of this data frame using commands you should already know. First let’s see what the structure of the data is using the <code>head</code> command, which will print the first 6 rows of data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(o_q)</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":[""],"name":["_rn_"],"type":[""],"align":["left"]},{"label":["agency_cd"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["site_no"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["Date"],"name":[3],"type":["date"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["X_00060_00003"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["X_00060_00003_cd"],"name":[5],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]}],"data":[{"1":"USGS","2":"14308500","3":"2015-10-01","4":"0.05","5":"A","_rn_":"1"},{"1":"USGS","2":"14308500","3":"2015-10-02","4":"0.06","5":"A","_rn_":"2"},{"1":"USGS","2":"14308500","3":"2015-10-03","4":"0.05","5":"A","_rn_":"3"},{"1":"USGS","2":"14308500","3":"2015-10-04","4":"0.03","5":"A","_rn_":"4"},{"1":"USGS","2":"14308500","3":"2015-10-05","4":"0.00","5":"A","_rn_":"5"},{"1":"USGS","2":"14308500","3":"2015-10-06","4":"0.00","5":"A","_rn_":"6"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<p>It looks like we have a dataframe that is 5 columns wide with columns <code>agency_cd</code> which is just the USGS, <code>site_no</code> which is just the site ids we already told it. A <code>Date</code> column which tells us… the date! There are two more columns that are kind of weird which are labeled <code>X_00060_00003</code> which is the column that actually has values of river flow in Cubic Feet Per Second (cfs), or the amount of water that is flowing by a location per second in Cubic Feet volume units (1 cubic foot ~ 7.5 gallons). Finally <code>X_00060_00003_cd</code> tells us something about the quality of the data. For now we will ignore this final column, but if you were doing an analysis of this data for a project, you would want to investigate what codes are acceptable for high quality analyses. To make working with this data a little easier let’s rename and remove some of our columns in a new, simpler data.frame.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Remove the first two columns and fifth columns
clean_q &lt;- o_q[,-c(1,5)]


#Rename the remaining columns
names(clean_q) &lt;- c(&#39;site_no&#39;,&#39;Date&#39;,&#39;q_cfs&#39;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-explore-the-data." class="section level3">
<h3>Explore the data.</h3>
<p>Now that we have cleaned up our data.frame a little, let’s explore the data. First we can use a summary command to just quickly look at the variables we have.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(clean_q)</code></pre>
<pre><code>FALSE    site_no               Date                q_cfs        
FALSE  Length:5379        Min.   :2015-10-01   Min.   :   0.00  
FALSE  Class :character   1st Qu.:2016-12-22   1st Qu.:   2.74  
FALSE  Mode  :character   Median :2018-03-15   Median :   5.51  
FALSE                     Mean   :2018-03-15   Mean   :  31.14  
FALSE                     3rd Qu.:2019-06-06   3rd Qu.:  21.20  
FALSE                     Max.   :2020-08-27   Max.   :2760.00</code></pre>
<p>It looks like we have data from 2015 to 2020-08-28 and a large range in flow conditions. If you’re a hydrologist, hopefully these flow numbers look right, but another way to check to make sure is to simply plot the data as we do below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(clean_q, aes(x=Date, y = q_cfs, color = site_no)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  theme_few() + 
  scale_color_few()</code></pre>
<p><img src="1_baseflow_vs_stormflow_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<div id="section-question-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Question 1)</h4>
<p>Make a similar plot to the one above, but change the y-axis to a log10 axis.</p>
<p>Hint: <code>scale_y_log10()</code> is a command you might want to investigate with <code>?scale_y_log10()</code></p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="log-plot" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="10">

</div>
<p>What does the log plot show that the unlogged data can’t?</p>

<div id="section-where-are-these-rivers-and-what-size-are-they" class="section level3">
<h3>Where are these rivers and what size are they?</h3>
<p>Before understanding why there might be large variations in how water moves through these different creeks, we might want to know where they are. We can use <code>dataRetrieval</code> data again here, which has a function <code>readNWISsite</code> that reads in metadata about each site including location information and drainage area information.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>site_info &lt;- readNWISsite(c(&#39;14353500&#39;,&#39;14353000&#39;,&#39;14308500&#39;)) %&gt;%

<h2>Analyze the data</h2>
<p>Now we have three time series to compare. But first we need to do some work to convert the discharge values, which are in daily mean cfs into area-adjusted discharge which will be in mm/day. These conversions make it easier to compare discharge dynamics across watersheds even though they are different sizes.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>q_mm &lt;- clean_q %&gt;%

<h3>Events versus seasonality</h3>
<p>Using the above plot to compare sites allows us to look at long term dynamics between the sites, but we can’t see specific events. To do that we can use a different plotting package that allows us to zoom in pretty easily. This package is called <code>dygraphs</code> and requires a small amount of adjusting to plot the data correctly.</p>

<h3>Question 4)</h3>
<p>When is discharge most different between sites? Do the sites vary mostly between seasons or during specific rain events?</p>
</div>
<div id="section-baseflow-separation" class="section level3">
<h3>Baseflow separation</h3>
<p>Here we will use the <code>EcoHydRology</code> package, which comes with a baseflow separation algorithm based on <a href="https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/39814986/Stochastic_Time-Variable_Rainfall-Runoff20151108-5238-xrczh.pdf?1447046845=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DStochastic_Time_Variable_Rainfall_Runoff.pdf&amp;Expires=1597091520&amp;Signature=gSFzI1vR9hLgSkkIVRjLZAUaCydIWas2P67dPyWbcC8wkfpescqARsJTCbDuQHrhezn94VnVAuY9uc6-exSf7NJ3x~yc6awMUw221iFmseOc7f2PhMFnCz0v34Yod8prIaheVSiDJYmt8nYaSMDR~DwygzREUsMX-xKDQpdwI499dgnDzXbYupUQtS7L4TEJFQ5vxVwXNf0WAwqUWA5sA69BB7NlWYgwA8~cKZWAb3ukoZlSq6Wjuqwlg3eTlIdq8-Evgu6~C2OQjI5yvHEzjj51~Iyfyjy9c~3Zbe3EnDzMwE~NWjhAWjorNgjolKH04i-ledZ1sBAOu54VDnXODQ__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA" target="_blank">Lyne and Hollick, 1979</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/WR026i007p01465" target="_blank">Nathan and McMahon, 1990</a>.</p>
<p>The function is simply called <code>BaseflowSeparation</code> and we will use it here. The algorithm relies on a smoothing filter that passes over the data between 1-3 times and a smoothing parameter between 0.9-0.95.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>q_mm_base &lt;- q_mm %&gt;%
  #group by site
  group_by(site_no) %&gt;%
  #apply the baseflow separation algorithm and return only baseflow
  mutate(bf_mm_day = BaseflowSeparation(q_mm_day,
                                        filter_parameter = 0.925,
                                        passes = 2)[,1])</code></pre>

<h3>Question 6</h3>
<p>Using the <code>mutate</code> command as seen in the above code, add a column of the % of Q that is baseflow (100*base/total). Then use <code>group_by</code> and <code>summarize</code> commands to quantiatively show which site has the highest discharge as baseflow.</p>
<p>Why might this site have such high baseflow?</p>
